Best4hire came to fruition with the need for any "x, y or z" company in need for employess. In others words this app is made for recruitment purposes and to collect the best among those showing in the database. It solves the problem of constantly looking for people to hire in everyother platform, when you can have it all in one. I was still reminded that imports are the strongest and fastest when it comes to data communiaction between files and that token are actually not that easy to create if not in the right environment. 


## Installation

To install this app you can click on the live link:
Or you can visit my repo at: https://github.com/Josie3fl/Best4hire

## Usage

Once in the live page the first thign you'll be able to see is the first candidate you will be able to select if you want them or not in you list. Next you can click on the "Potantial Candidates" section to verify the saved candidates and see the list of people previously saved.
